    <h2>What is Pulla?</h2>
    <p> <em>Pulla</em> is a mildly-sweet <strong>Finnish</strong> 
        <a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet">sweet</a> roll or dessert bread flavored with 
        crushed cardamom seeds and occasionally raisins or sliced almonds. 
        Braided loaves (pitko) are formed from three or more strands of dough. 
        The loaves may also be formed into a ring. </p>
        <p>They are typically coated with 
        <strong>egg</strong> wash and then sprinkled with white sugar or almonds. Other types of pulla
        include small round buns that resemble English scones but have a sugar and 
        butter topping, and larger cinnamon rolls called <em>korvapuusti</em>. The outside 
        typically has a shiny, brown glaze, formed by a coating of egg white, milk 
        or a mixture of sugar and brewed coffee. </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cuprs of milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of warm water</li>
        <li>1 package of acrive dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <l1>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</l1>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>9 cups of flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of melted butter</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vBGOrI6yBk">sugar</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add yeast to warm milk and mix well. Milk needs to be 99°F / 37°C to 
            activate the fresh yeast. If you are using instant yeast, the milk should 
            be 108°F / 42°C. 
        </li>
        <li> I heat the milk in a microwave and check the temperature with my finger. 
            If the milk doesn’t feel cold or hot, it’s perfect for fresh yeast.</li>
        <li>Whisk in sugar, vanilla sugar, salt, and cardamom. Stir in flour one cup 
            at a time and a dough begins to form.</li>
        <li>Use your hands to knead the dough in the bowl. It should become elastic. 
            Add butter and continue to knead the butter in. </li>
        <li>In total, around five minutes of kneading should be fine. Now you have a 
            smooth dough ball in the bowl. Cover the bowl with a towel and leave in a 
            warm place. </li>
         <li>I often use a microwave, but off-mode! Preheat the microwave by heating a 
            cup of water. Take the cup away. Then put the bowl with the towel into the 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave_oven">microwave</a> and leave 
            to rest.</li>
        <li>PS. If you love pulla, check my tutorial for Finnish winter buns with whipped 
            cream and jam!</li>
